    "Matrix Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix decomposition is a way of reducing a matrix into its constituent parts.\n",
    "It is an approach that can simplify more complex matrix operations that can be performed on the decomposed matrix rather than on the original matrix itself.\n",
    "A common analogy for matrix decomposition is the factoring of numbers, such as the factoring of 10 into 2 x 5. For this reason, matrix decomposition is also called matrix factorization. Like factoring real values, there are many ways to decompose a matrix, hence there are a range of different matrix decomposition techniques.\n",
    "Two simple and widely used matrix decomposition methods are the LU matrix decomposition and the QR matrix decomposition.\n",
    "Next, we will take a closer look at each of these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "LU Matrix Decomposition\n",
    "The LU decomposition is for square matrices and decomposes a matrix into L and U components.\n",
    "1\tA = L . U\n",
    "Or, without the dot notation.\n",
    "1\tA = LU\n",
    "Where A is the square matrix that we wish to decompose, L is the lower triangle matrix and U is the upper triangle matrix.\n",
    "The factors L and U are triangular matrices. The factorization that comes from elimination is A = LU.\n",
    "The LU decomposition is found using an iterative numerical process and can fail for those matrices that cannot be decomposed or decomposed easily.\n",
    "A variation of this decomposition that is numerically more stable to solve in practice is called the LUP decomposition, or the LU decomposition with partial pivoting.\n",
    "1\tA = P . L . U\n",
    "The rows of the parent matrix are re-ordered to simplify the decomposition process and the additional P matrix specifies a way to permute the result or return the result to the original order. There are also other variations of the LU.\n",
    "The LU decomposition is often used to simplify the solving of systems of linear equations, such as finding the coefficients in a linear regression, as well as in calculating the determinant and inverse of a matrix.\n",
    "The LU decomposition can be implemented in Python with the lu() function. More specifically, this function calculates an LPU decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below first defines a 3×3 square matrix. The LU decomposition is calculated, then the original matrix is reconstructed from the components."

    "The QR decomposition can be implemented in NumPy using the qr() function. By default, the function returns the Q and R matrices with smaller or ‘reduced’ dimensions that is more economical. We can change this to return the expected sizes of m x m for Q and m x n for R by specifying the mode argument as ‘complete’, although this is not required for most applications.\n",

When you can use it, Cholesky decomposition is about a factor of two faster than alternative methods for solving linear equations.\n",
